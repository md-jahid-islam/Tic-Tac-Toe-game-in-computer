Hi I'm Jahidul Islam as a creator Tic Tac Toe game in computer use to html, css, javascript, 
To implement a Tic Tac Toe game with a computer player (AI) that can replay moves, you can break it down into these steps:
Create a 3x3 grid for the board and display it to the user.
Allow the player to input their move (X).
The computer (O) will choose a move based on a basic strategy (like picking an empty spot at random or using a minimax algorithm for more intelligent moves).
After each move, update and display the board.
Check for a win or draw after each move.
If there's a winner or the game ends in a draw, display the result.
Allow the user to restart the game after it ends.
Keep track of the game history to allow for replay.
Enable the option to review previous moves by replaying the history.
Use an array to store the moves and implement a replay function that shows each move in order.
